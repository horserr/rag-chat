### 8. ✅ Error Resolution

## Architecture Changes

- Upload/create buttons in explorer toolbar
- Details panel with tabbed interface (collapsible)
- Windows File Explorer-like appearance

## Key Features

1. **View Types**: List and card view for sources
2. **Context Menus**: Right-click actions for sources
3. **Collapsible Panel**: Maximize explorer space when needed
4. **Toolbar Actions**: Integrated source creation and file upload
5. **Windows Styling**: Familiar interface with appropriate borders and backgrounds

## Technical Implementation

- **Framework**: React with TypeScript

- **State Management**: Props-based state management
- **Animations**: CSS transitions for smooth user experience
- **File Organization**: Logical separation into explorer/ and panels/ subfolders

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED

The knowledge page has been successfully restructured with a Windows File Explorer-like interface. All compilation errors have been resolved, and the application builds and runs successfully.

### Next Steps (Optional)
- User testing to gather feedback on the new interface
- Performance optimization if needed
- Additional features like drag-and-drop file uploads
