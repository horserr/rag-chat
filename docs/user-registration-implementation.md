# User Registration Feature Implementation

## Overview
I've successfully added user registration functionality to the RAG Chat application with the following features:

## New Features Added

### 1. Service Layer Implementation
- **Extended AuthService** (`src/services/auth/auth.service.ts`):
  - `sendVerificationCode()` - Sends email verification code
  - `register()` - Creates new user account

### 2. Data Models
- **Updated auth models** (`src/models/auth.ts`):
  - `RegisterDto` - Registration data structure
  - `VerificationCodeDto` - Email verification request
  - `VerificationCodeResponse` - Verification response
  - `RegisterResponse` - Registration response

### 3. React Hooks
- **useRegistration** (`src/hooks/auth/useRegistration.ts`):
  - Handles user registration with error handling
  - Manages loading states and success feedback

- **useVerificationCode** (`src/hooks/auth/useRegistration.ts`):
  - Sends email verification codes
  - Implements 60-second countdown to prevent spam
  - Manages verification state

### 4. UI Components

#### Main Components
- **AuthContainer** (`src/components/login/AuthContainer.tsx`):
  - Switches between login and registration forms
  - Smooth animations between states

- **RegisterForm** (`src/components/login/RegisterForm.tsx`):
  - Complete registration form with validation
  - Integration with verification and captcha systems

#### Form Components
- **RegisterFormFields** - Input fields for registration
- **RegisterFormSubmit** - Submit button with loading states
- **RegisterFormError** - Error message display
- **RegisterSuccess** - Success confirmation screen

#### Security Features
- **SimpleCaptcha** (`src/components/login/SimpleCaptcha.tsx`):
  - Math-based human verification (e.g., "3 + 7 = ?")
  - Prevents automated registration attempts
  - Refreshable questions
  - Visual feedback for verification status

### 5. User Experience Features

#### Registration Flow
1. **User Input**: Name, email, password, confirm password
2. **Human Verification**: Simple math captcha
3. **Email Verification**: Send verification code to email
4. **Account Creation**: Submit registration with verification code
5. **Success Feedback**: Confirmation and redirect to login

#### Form Validation
- Real-time password confirmation matching
- Email format validation
- Required field validation
- Captcha verification requirement
- Verification code requirement

#### Security Measures
- Captcha verification before sending email codes
- 60-second cooldown between verification code requests
- Password visibility toggle
- Input sanitization and validation

### 6. API Integration
Based on the endpoints in `new_user.http`:

```http
# Send verification code
POST /auth/verify_code
Content-Type: application/json
{
    "email": "user@example.com"
}

# Create new user
POST /auth/user
Content-Type: application/json
{
    "name": "Full Name",
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "password": "password123",
    "verification_code": "ABC123"
}
```

## How to Use

### For Users
1. Navigate to the login page
2. Click "Create Account" to switch to registration
3. Fill in your information:
   - Full name
   - Email address
   - Password and confirmation
4. Complete the captcha verification
5. Click "Send Code" to receive email verification
6. Enter the verification code from your email
7. Click "Create Account" to complete registration
8. Upon success, click "Sign In Now" to return to login

### For Developers
- All registration components are exported from `src/components/login/index.ts`
- Hooks are available in `src/hooks/auth/index.ts`
- Service methods are in `src/services/auth/auth.service.ts`

## Technical Implementation Details

### State Management
- Uses React Query for API state management
- Local state for form data and UI states
- Proper error handling and loading states

### Form Validation
- Real-time validation feedback
- Comprehensive error messages
- Disabled states for incomplete forms

### Security Considerations
- Captcha prevents automated registrations
- Email verification ensures valid email addresses
- Rate limiting on verification code requests
- Input validation and sanitization

### Accessibility
- Proper ARIA labels and descriptions
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader friendly error messages
- High contrast visual feedback

## Testing the Feature

1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:5174/`
3. Click "Create Account" on the login page
4. Test the complete registration flow

## Troubleshooting

### TypeScript Compilation Issues
During Docker build, there were some TypeScript compilation errors that have been resolved:

1. **Boolean Type Error in RegisterFormFields**: Fixed type mismatch where `boolean | ""` was not assignable to `boolean | undefined` by wrapping the condition in `Boolean()`.

2. **Unused Import in RegisterSuccess**: Removed unused `Box` import from Material-UI components.

These fixes ensure that the application builds successfully in production environments with strict TypeScript checking.

### Build Verification
- ✅ TypeScript compilation: `npx tsc -b --noEmit`
- ✅ Production build: `npm run build`
- ✅ Docker build compatibility verified

The registration system is now fully integrated and ready for use!
