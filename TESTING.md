# Chat Functionality Testing Guide

This guide explains how to test the chat functionality fixes implemented in our RAG Chat application.

## What Was Fixed

1. **API URL Paths**: Fixed inconsistent URL paths in API calls that were causing connection errors
   - Removed redundant leading slashes in API endpoints
   - Ensured consistent path handling across all services

2. **Message Streaming**: Improved the message streaming experience
   - Added visual feedback for streaming messages
   - Enhanced error handling for failed API calls
   - Fixed JSON parsing for streamed responses

3. **Authentication**: Enhanced token handling
   - Added proper token expiration handling
   - Improved redirect to login when token expires
   - Fixed token storage in the login page

4. **UI Enhancements**:
   - Added loading animations and indicators
   - Improved error message display
   - Enhanced visual feedback when sending messages

## Testing Steps

### 1. Basic Login Flow
1. Start the application with `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to the login page
3. Enter valid credentials
4. Verify you're redirected to the chat page

### 2. Session Management
1. On the chat page, check if sessions load in the sidebar
2. Create a new session using the "New" button
3. Try switching between sessions
4. Delete a session and verify it's removed from the list

### 3. Chat Functionality
1. Type a message and send it
2. Verify the message appears in the chat
3. Verify you receive a response from the AI
4. Check if streaming updates the message in real-time

### 4. Error Handling
1. Test with an expired token (can be simulated by modifying localStorage)
2. Verify you're redirected to the login page
3. Try disconnecting from the network and sending a message
4. Verify appropriate error messages are displayed

## API Connection Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with API connectivity, you can use the test script:

```bash
node src/test_api.js YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN
```

This script will test the basic API endpoints and report any issues.

## Remaining Known Issues

- The streaming message parser may need optimization for different response formats
- Session title updates are not yet implemented
- Mobile UI could be further optimized
